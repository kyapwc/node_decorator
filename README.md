# Node Decorators
As of right now, July 2024, NodeJS does not support decorator patterns and need to use the concept of HOF (Higher Order Functions)

The code in `index.js` and `./services/index.js` is just my rudimentary implementation to check caching, logging and checking duration of function executions

It is only meant as a POC, playing around and not meant for other usage. It is solely me just playing around with HOFs.
